**jQuery Plugin: Display Your Coding Badges**

Have several coding tutorial badges you've earned from [Code School](https://www.codeschool.com/) and [Treehouse](https://teamtreehouse.com/home) that you'd like to display on your site? This simple jQuery plugin makes that possible, whether your site is hand-coded, or created using a popular CMS such as WordPress or Drupal.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository
2. Navigate to your local copy of index.html through your web browser to see
   a basic example of the badges using my usernames
3. Navigate to your local copy of the dist folder
4. Adjust the CSS/main.css file to fit your needs
5. Include the CSS/main.css and JS/main.js files in your project
6. Include the following div tag or a tag you specify (section etc.), replacing "yourUsername" with your Code School and Treehouse usernames:

`<div class="insignia" data-codeschool="yourUsername" data-treehouse="yourUsername"></div>`
