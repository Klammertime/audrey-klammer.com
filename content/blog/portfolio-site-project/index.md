**Project 1: Build a Portfolio Site (70 hrs)** ~ [Udacity Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree Program](https://www.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd001)

I replicated a [design mockup](https://storage.googleapis.com/supplemental_media/udacityu/2655898586/design-mockup-portfolio.pdf) in HTML and CSS. Once successfully replicated, I continued making customizations to the design to personalize it. I decided to take this opportunity to practice using Flexbox.
